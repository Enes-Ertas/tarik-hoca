Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?",is honored,would be honored,will be honored,had been honored,B,"Correct Answer:
B) would be honored  
This choice correctly uses would be honored to describe a future action from the perspective of a past event, conforming to the conventions of Standard English.

Explanation:
 A) is honored  
   - Incorrect. The present tense is honored does not fit the context since it describes an event that happened in the past (Years later).

B) would be honored  
   - Correct. This choice uses would be honored, which appropriately indicates a future action from a past perspective. It suggests that at some point after 1987, Zewail was expected to be honored.

C) will be honored  
   - Incorrect. The future tense will be honored does not fit the context since the sentence refers to an event that has already occurred.

D) had been honored

1dfd5bcd-eafe-446a-ba78-54ae1b18ec77,"The mantis shrimp, a small marine creature, has one of the fastest and most powerful strikes in the animal kingdom, capable of reaching speeds of up to 23 meters per second. The impact of its punch induces tremendous heat—reaching temperatures as much as Sun's surface—during contact whenever it's attacking. In comparison, the strike of a snake, such as the rattlesnake, is also impressively fast, typically reaching speeds of around 2.6 meters per second. While the snake’s strike is primarily used for injecting venom into prey, the mantis shrimp’s punch is designed to break hard shells and even produce cavitation bubbles that add destructive force. Both animals have evolved these rapid strikes to catch prey and defend themselves, but the mantis shrimp's speed and mechanism are unparalleled, even in the context of rapid animal movements.\n\nWhat is the function of the underlined sentence, in the context of the passage as a whole?","It elucidates the divergent evolutionary purposes of the mantis shrimp's and the snake's rapid strikes, delineating how these adaptations cater to their respective ecological niches and survival strategies.","It juxtaposes the relative efficiency of the mantis shrimp’s punch with the snake’s strike, insinuating a hierarchical view of animal adaptations that undervalues the snake’s predatory mechanisms.","It postulates a hypothetical scenario in which the mantis shrimp’s strike mechanism could supersede terrestrial predation tactics, thereby challenging traditional perspectives on evolutionary specialization among vertebrates.","It insuniates that the mantis shrimp’s strike poses a greater evolutionary advantage than the snake’s, suggesting a potential superiority of aquatic predation methods over terrestrial ones.",A,"Correct Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Choice A (Correct Answer): This option uses more complex language to describe the function of the sentence. It indicates that the sentence is clarifying the different evolutionary adaptations of both animals, showing how each has developed a unique method for hunting and defense that is suited to its specific environment and needs.\n\n- Choice B: This distractor option misleads by suggesting a comparison that diminishes the effectiveness of the snake’s adaptations. The passage does not imply a superiority-inferiority hierarchy but rather focuses on different functional adaptations.\n\n- Choice C: This choice introduces a hypothetical and overly speculative scenario that is not supported by the passage. It suggests that the mantis shrimp’s strike could be a universal predation tactic, which is not the focus of the passage.\n\n- Choice D: This option incorrectly interprets the passage as suggesting the superiority of one animal’s adaptation over the other. The passage discusses distinct adaptations, not a competitive advantage between aquatic and terrestrial predation methods.\n\nIn summary, Choice A best captures the function of the sentence by describing how it delineates the different purposes and effectiveness of the mantis shrimp’s and the snake’s striking mechanisms within their ecological contexts.\n\nHere are the explanations for the words used in the explanation, along with their meanings, pronunciations, and example sentences:\n\n1.

However, the student claims that readers of serialized novels in the 19th century were more interested in character development and story resolution than in sensational plot twists.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the student's claim?",The final installment of The Mysteries of London was more widely read than previous installments in the series.,The most popular installment of The Mysteries of London featured a shocking plot twist.,The Mysteries of London was praised by contemporary critics for its sensational storytelling style.,The first installment of The Mysteries of London was considered the least engaging by most readers of the time.,A,"The student's claim is that readers preferred character development and story resolution over sensational plot twists. If the final installment, which likely offers the resolution to the story, was more widely read than any previous installment, this would support the idea that readers were most interested in the conclusion, thereby supporting the student's claim about their preferences. Closure in the context of storytelling refers to the resolution or conclusion of a narrative, where conflicts are resolved, and the story reaches a satisfying end. It gives the audience a sense of completeness, where loose ends are tied up, and questions raised during the narrative are answered.\n\nTension, on the other hand, refers to the sense of uncertainty, suspense, or anxiety that keeps the audience engaged, wondering what will happen next. Tension is often created by conflict, unanswered questions, or unresolved situations within the story.\n\nWhen a student claims that audiences preferred resolution and closure over ongoing tension, it means that audiences were more interested in seeing the story come to a satisfying end (closure) rather than being left in a state of constant suspense or uncertainty (tension). In other words, they wanted to see how the conflicts would be resolved and how the story would end, rather than just experiencing continuous suspense without resolution.",2025-06-24 04:03:45.002152+00,

I sat near the bow of the boat, gazing at the rocky cliffs and small villages carved into the hills of Sivas. As we moved past the last bend near Kırıkkale, the landscape began to change. The sharp, jagged rocks gave way to wide plains, golden wheat fields, and tranquil stretches of water. The river, once rushing and narrow between the highlands, now seemed to exhale, moving slowly and peacefully across the Anatolian heartland, as if it had remembered a more ancient, calmer rhythm. Based on the text, which choice best expresses the narrator’s characterization of the Kızılırmak River?",The Kızılırmak River maintains its rapid flow throughout its journey from the mountains to the plains.,The author sees the Kızılırmak as a symbol of Turkey’s technological and urban progress.,The river’s transition from rugged highlands to calm plains mirroring the character’s tranquility,The river becomes increasingly narrow portrays an image of seclusion and alienation,C,"The narrator describes how the river changes character—from rough and fast in the mountains to calm and slow in the plains.

The resulting body of work evokes a paradoxical and contrasting sense of both chaos and order, rigidity and flow. Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",collaborative,indistinct,disparate,harmonious,C,"Correct Answer: C
Choice C is the best answer because it most precisely and logically completes the sentence. The phrase “tension among her _____ influences” suggests that the styles influencing Velasquez’s work are markedly different from one another. The passage lists influences that vary greatly in form and intent: minimalist architecture (neutral and sparse), psychedelic art (bold and chaotic), and indigenous textiles (intricate and symbolic). The word disparate, meaning “essentially different in kind,” accurately captures the contrast among these styles and supports the idea of a “paradoxical sense” in her work.
Choice A, collaborative, incorrectly implies that the styles worked together toward a shared goal, which doesn’t match the idea of visual tension.
Choice B, indistinct, contradicts the clearly described characteristics of each influence.
Choice D, harmonious, suggests smooth unity, which is the opposite of the tension the sentence emphasizes.",2025-06-24 04:46:51.280137+00,

In recent decades, coastal towns along Turkey’s western shoreline have experienced increasingly severe erosion, due in part to both climate change and unchecked urban development. Natural sand barriers have been depleted, and rising sea levels, combined with poorly planned construction projects, have aggravated the loss of shoreline. Without proper intervention, many waterfront communities could face irreversible damage within the next two decades.

While the events and setting are rooted in the 1930s, the book is far more intricate than the genre label suggests. With its fragmented structure, philosophical digressions, and surreal humor, the novel resists simple classification and instead critiques modernization and bureaucracy through a uniquely introspective lens. Text 2 Some critics view historical fiction as a genre where authors focus excessively on showing off their elaborate knowledge of period details rather than conveying emotionally resonant or thematically rich narratives. While there are exceptions, these critics argue that many historical novels become overwhelmed by factual accuracy at the expense of character depth or meaningful insight. Still, historical fiction, when executed with balance, can offer powerful reflections on cultural memory and national identity.

This behavior is likely because lower moonlight reduces the visibility for their prey, making it easier for owls to catch them without being detected.

Scientific consensus had long held that early dogs were large and that the genetic basis for smaller size in breeds like the Kangal Terrier emerged within the last 20,000 years, due to selective breeding by humans. However, the researchers challenged this view, arguing that the explanation is flawed. They found that a mutation in the IGF1 gene, which regulates insulin-like growth factor 1 and influences body size, is widespread among domestic dog breeds. Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' assertion?","The mutation related to IGF1 influences body size and is found in 53,000-year-old genetic material from fossils of Siberian wolves (Canis lupus campestris), an ancestor of dogs.","One variant of IGF1 is found only in smaller dog breeds like Kangals and appears to have emerged no more than 20,000 years ago.",An additional mutation related to IGF1 affects the development of characteristics other than body size in smaller dog breeds like Kangals.,"IGF1 has been isolated in genetic material from fossils more than 20,000 years old of the red wolf (Canis rufus) and certain other species related to dogs.",A,"The correct answer is A because it provides evidence that the mutation related to IGF1, which influences body size, was present in the ancestor of dogs 53,000 years ago, challenging the idea that the genetic basis for smaller size in modern dogs emerged only in the last 20,000 years.",2025-06-24 04:46:51.280137+00,

I am a sick man… I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However, I don’t consult a doctor for it, though I respect medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine anyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am superstitious).

The Underground Man openly admits, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine anyway. This contradiction suggests that his refusal to see a doctor is influenced by his irrational and conflicting beliefs rather than logical reasoning. He acknowledges that he respects medicine but simultaneously lets his superstition override that respect, making A the best choice.

		B suggests fear of a diagnosis, but he never expresses concern about the severity of his illness.
		C implies that he fully trusts medicine but thinks his case is untreatable, which contradicts his conflicting stance on medicine.
		D assumes he has his own healing methods, but the passage does not suggest this—his refusal is based more on irrational superstition than confidence in an alternative cure.
Word Meaning: Spiteful 
Meaning: Acting with resentment or irrational opposition, often rejecting help or good advice out of stubbornness rather than reason.
Example sentences:
		Out of spite, he refused to admit that he needed assistance.
		Her spiteful refusal to listen only made her situation worse.
		The Underground Man’s refusal to see a doctor is driven not just by spite but also by his irrational superstitions.
Mnemonic to Remember:
Think of spiteful as someone who rejects something not because it’s wrong, but just to be difficult or oppositional.

		Resentful
		Defiant
